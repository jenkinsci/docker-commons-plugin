Declarative pipeline example
---

An example on how to bind Docker host/daemon credentials in a declarative pipeline: 
```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  tools {
    // a bit ugly because there is no `@Symbol` annotation for the DockerTool
    // see the discussion about this in PR 77 and PR 52: 
    // https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-commons-plugin/pull/77#discussion_r280910822
    // https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-commons-plugin/pull/52
    'org.jenkinsci.plugins.docker.commons.tools.DockerTool' '18.09'
  }
  environment {
    DOCKER_CERT_PATH = credentials('id-for-a-docker-cred')
  }
  stages {
    stage('foo') {
      steps {
        sh "docker version" // DOCKER_CERT_PATH is automatically picked up by the Docker client
      }
    }
  }
}
```
